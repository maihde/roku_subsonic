Known Issues
------------
1. With Subsonic 4.5 and earlier, transcoded files play only a portion of the file.
   Subsonic 4.6 resolves this issue. See this link for a patch 
   of 4.4 and 4.5:

   http://www.activeobjects.no/subsonic/forum/viewtopic.php?p=26893#26893

2. roGridScreen doesn't cooperate with roAudioPlayer running in the background.
   If the roAudioPlayer sends an event while the grid screen is visible, the 
   album artwork get's scaled funny; this odd GridScreen behavior is in addition
   to the typical issues with roGridScreen that prevent normal stacking behavior.

3. When returning from the search roGridScreen to the main roGridScreen, a small
   delay must manually be introduced, otherwise the main grid screen get's corrupted.

4. Music must be organized in "Artist/Album/Songs" and/or "Artist/Songs" directory structure.

5. On roku firmware version 3.0, button clicks will cause gaps in audio playback.
   Turn Sound-Effects to "Off" if this is bothersome.  This seems to be fixed in firmware version 3.1
   
6. roGridScreen does not load images from https URLs

7. When using https, the Roku requires a certificate name that matches the server URL exactly.  This is
   because many Roku objects (roPosterScreen, roGridScreen, etc.) don't allow strict host checking to
   be disabled.  Currently only roUrlTransfer allows strict host checking to be disabled.
